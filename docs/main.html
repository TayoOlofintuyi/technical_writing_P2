        <h2 id="board-overview">Introduction</h2>
        <p>The Minesweeper board consists of various characters representing different elements. Understanding these characters is crucial for playing the game:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong><img src="images/covered.png" width="50" height="50"></strong>: Represents a covered square that may or may not contain a mine.</li>
            <li><strong><img src="images/uncovered.png" width="50" height="50"></strong>: Indicates an uncovered square with no mines around it.</li>
            <li><img src="images/uncovered1.png" width="50" height="50">         <img src="images/uncovered2.png" width="50" height="50">         <img src="images/uncovered3.png" width="50" height="50">         <img src="images/uncovered4.png" width="50" height="50">         <img src="images/uncovered5.png" width="50" height="50">         <img src="images/uncovered6.png" width="50" height="50">         <img src="images/uncovered7.png" width="50" height="50">         <img src="images/uncovered8.png" width="50" height="50">: Indicates the number of mines in adjacent squares when revealed.</li>
            <li><strong><img src="images/flag.png" width="50" height="50"></strong>: A flagged square, marked by the player as a potential mine.</li>
            <li><strong><img src="images/mine.png" width="50" height="50"><img src="images/clicked_mine.png" width="50" height="50"></strong>: A revealed mine and a revealed mine that has been clicked respectfully. Both indicate a game that has ended.</li>
        </ul>
        <div class="example">

        </div>

        <div id="controls">
            <h2>Controls</h2>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Left Click:</strong> Reveal a square</li>
                <li><strong>Right Click:</strong> Mark a square with a flag</li>
            </ul>
            <div class="example">

                <img src="images/mouse_controls1.png" width="300" height="300">
    
                
            </div>
        </div>

        <h2 id="click-to-reveal">Step 1: Click to Reveal</h2>
        <p>Start by left-clicking on a covered square to reveal its content. The grid is initially filled with covered squares, and your goal is to uncover all non-mine squares.</p>
        <div class="example">
            <img src="images/oneclick.png" alt="First click">
        </div>

        <h2 id="use-numbers">Step 2: Use Numbers</h2>
        <p>Numbers on revealed squares indicate the count of mines in adjacent squares. Leverage this information to deduce mine locations. If a square has the number "2," two mines are present in the surrounding eight squares.</p>
        <div class="example">
            <img src="images/this_square_is_a_mine.png" alt="If there is there is only one square around a 1, then that square is a mine.">
        </div>

        <h2 id="avoid-mines">Step 3: Avoid Mines</h2>
        <p>Caution is crucial. If you accidentally reveal a mine, the game ends. Mines are randomly scattered, making each move a calculated risk. Be strategic and observe the numbers to identify potential mine locations.</p>
        <div class="example">
            <img src="images/this_must_be_safe.png" alt="If there is a known mine around a 1, then any other square around that 1 is safe">
        </div>

        <h2 id="mark-with-flags">Step 4: Mark with Flags</h2>
        <p>Right-click on a square to mark it with a flag if you suspect it contains a mine. Flagging helps keep track of potential mines and avoids accidental clicks.</p>
        <div class="example">
            <img src="images/we_can_flag_it.png" alt="This must be a mine so we can flag it.">
        </div>

        <h2 id="win-the-game">Step 5: Win the Game</h2>
        <p>Continue revealing and flagging until all non-mine squares are uncovered. A successful completion reveals a safe configuration.</p>
        <div class="example">
            <img src="images/finished_game.png" alt="Finished game">
        </div>
