        <h2 id="gametab">The Game Tab</h2>
        <p>Located above the top left corner of the game board the Game tab allows players to select the difficulty they wish to play. To access the game tab, click the text above the game board labeled "Game". This will reveal four game difficulties: Beginner, Intermediate, Expert, Custom. These difficulties change the width of the board which increases the amount of mines on the board. The corresponding board sizes and mine counts are listed in table form beside each difficulty option. You select each difficulty by clicking the empty circles. These difficulty levels allow players to choose their preferred level of challenge, with Easy serving as a beginner-friendly introduction to the game and Hard offering a formidable test of Minesweeper skills as well as custom allowing freedom to the game the user wishes to play. Choose the difficulty level that best suits your skill level and desire for a Minesweeper gaming experience. If you have never played Minesweeper before, start with easy and work yourself throught the difficulties</p>

        <h2 id="display">Display</h2>
        <p> The "Display Menu," located beside the game menu, allows users to tailor the website's visual and physical aspects, offering customization options for improving their Minesweeper gaming experience. To access the Display Menu, click the blue highlighted text labeled "Menu". There are three options for zooming in: 100%, 150%, and 200%. There is a center and left position.

        <h2 id="control">Controls</h2>
        <p> Next to the Display tab the controls menu displays all of the controls for the game.</p>

        <h2 id="importexport">Import and Export</h2>
        <p> The "Import" and "Export" tabs are closely linked features that facilitate the sharing of game setups among users. When you want to import a game setup created by another user, you need to obtain a unique identification code for that specific game, which is generated in the "Export" tab. To share a game setup, the user goes to the "Export" tab and copies the game's unique ID. This ID is like a digital signature for that particular game configuration. Once you have this ID, you can head to the "Import" tab. In the "Import" tab, there is an input field where you paste the game ID you obtained from the other user. After pasting the ID, you can click the "Load Game" button. This action tells the game to load the specific game setup associated with that unique ID.</p>

        <h2 id="flagging">Flagging</h2>
        <p> Located at the top left corner of the Minesweeper game board, you'll find the "Flag Counter." This counter displays the total number of mines present in the current puzzle. As players flag tiles, the counter decreases, providing a real-time count of the remaining mines. </p>

        <h2 id="smiley">Smiley</h2>
        <p> The face at the top of the board in Minesweeper not only serves as a visual element but also has a functional role in the game. Its expressions are linked to your progress and actions during the game. When you click on the face, it resets the current game, giving you a fresh start. If you accidentally reveal a mine, the face will turn into a sad expression to indicate that you've lost, and the game will be over. However, when you successfully clear the minefield by flagging all the mines and revealing all safe cells, the face will sport a joyful, victorious expression, signaling your success. This dual function of the face in Minesweeper, both as an emotional indicator and a game-reset button, adds a delightful and user-friendly dimension to the game's interface, making it a beloved and enduring feature of this classic puzzle game.</p>

        <h2 id="timer">Timer</h2>
        <p>The timer in Minesweeper serves as a crucial component of the gameplay experience, offering players a precise measure of the time they spend navigating the minefield. Positioned near the top-right corner of the game board, the timer activates as soon as players embark on a new game by clicking on their first tile. From that moment, it diligently records the elapsed time in seconds up to 999, providing players with real-time feedback on their progress. Overall, the timer is an invaluable tool, enabling players to challenge themselves, compete for faster solving times, and enhance their Minesweeper skills.</p>

        <h2 id="leaderboard">Leaderboard</h2>
        <p> The Minesweeper leaderboard located under the board, is a feature that showcases the top global scores achieved by users who have successfully cleared the minefield in the shortest amount of time. It not only ranks players based on their overall performance but also categorizes them into different skill levels, such as beginner, intermediate, and expert, allowing for fair competition among players of varying skill levels. Moreover, the leaderboard provides users with insights into the fastest times achieved in different time frames, including today, this week, this month, and all-time, offering a comprehensive overview of players' performance trends and achievements over different periods. </p>
